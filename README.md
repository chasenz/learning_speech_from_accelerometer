# Learning-Speech-from-Accelerometer-Measurements

We recognize and reconstruct speech information/signal from accelerometer in this project. 
The accelerometer measurements are preprocessed by Matlab code into acceleration spectrograms, and then, the accerelation spectrograms are input into DenseNet/StyleTransfer for recognization and reconstruction.
The reconstructed speech spectrograms will be processed by GL algorithm to reconstruct the speech signal.

Due to security issues and requirements from certain companies, we could not release the code at this time. The code will be released in the future.

And we also need to withdraw the code we released previously. Sorry for the inconvenience.
